# Horiseon-Refractor

## Description
The first challenge in my fullstack bootcamp. This project involved changing the source code of a website for a fictitious internet technology company "Horiseon". 
The source code was refractored to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines. Alot of arbitrary classes and selectors were consolidated to make the source code more approachable.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
>All instances of <div> have been replaced with appropriate semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
>HTML elements are structured based on function within the page, classes and id's have been reduced to the bare minimum.

WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
>Every image element now contains an alt attribute with the image description

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
>heading attributes in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
>page now has descriptive title
```
> * CSS has been consolidated and cleaned up substantially
> * Text has been altered to be more legible to a wider audience
> * HTML has been modernized and better organized
> * Proper commentary has been made to HTML and CSS
