# Horiseon-Refractor
The first challenge in my fullstack bootcamp

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
>All instances of <div> have been replaced with appropriate semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
>HTML elements are structured based on function within the page, classes and id's have been reduced to the bare minimum.

WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
>Every image element now contains an alt attribute with the image description

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
>heading attributes in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
>page now has descriptive title
```
